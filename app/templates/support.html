                    <p class="faq-question">How many questions are in the app?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        Ace Citizenship includes all 128 official USCIS civics questions updated for 2025.
                        These are the same questions used in the actual naturalization interview.

                    <p class="faq-question">How does spaced repetition work?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        When you answer a question incorrectly, it goes back into the deck and will
                        appear again later. This helps you focus on questions you need to practice
                        more, making your study time more efficient.

                    <p class="faq-question">Why do I need to select my state?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        Some civics questions ask about your state's senators, governor, and capital.
                        By selecting your state, the app automatically fills in the correct answers
                        for these location-specific questions.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="faq-question">What about my U.S. Representative?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        Unlike senators and governors which are state-wide, your representative
                        depends on your specific congressional district. You'll need to enter
                        your representative's name manually. You can find this information at
                        <a href="https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative" target="_blank">house.gov</a>.
