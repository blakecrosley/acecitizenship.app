# Ace Citizenship App Integration Points

Guidelines for when and how to mention the Ace Citizenship app in blog content.

## Core Principle

**Lead with value, not product.** Every post should be useful to someone preparing for the citizenship test, regardless of what tools they use. App mentions should feel like helpful suggestions, not advertisements.

## Integration Frequency

### Per Article Guidelines

- **Maximum 2 app mentions** per 1,000 words
- **Never in the opening** - earn attention first
- **Natural placement only** - if it feels forced, cut it

### Where to Integrate

**Good placements:**
- When discussing spaced repetition or study strategies
- In "how to practice" sections where the app would help
- At article end as a "if you want a free study tool" suggestion
- When explaining official USCIS questions

**Poor placements:**
- Opening paragraphs
- Mid-explanation interruptions
- Every section
- As a solution to problems you just raised

## Integration Styles

### The Soft Mention
Use when the app is tangentially relevant:

> Spaced repetition helps you focus on questions you haven't mastered yet, rather than reviewing what you already know. Many study apps use this technique to make learning more efficient.

(No app name needed - readers will connect if interested)

### The Direct Mention
Use when discussing specific features:

> Ace Citizenship includes all 128 official USCIS questions with explanations, so you can understand why each answer is correct, not just memorize responses.

### The CTA Close
Use at article end, once per piece maximum:

> If you're looking for a free way to practice the citizenship test, Ace Citizenship includes all official USCIS questions with spaced repetition to help you focus on what you need to learn.

## What NOT to Do

### Hard Sell Language
- "You NEED Ace Citizenship to pass"
- "Ace Citizenship is the BEST citizenship app"
- "Don't take the test without Ace Citizenship"

### Artificial Problems
- Creating anxiety just to solve it with the app
- Implying you can't pass without an app
- Suggesting other preparation methods are inadequate

### Over-featuring
- Listing every feature in non-feature articles
- Multiple CTAs in one article
- Promotional language ("limited time", "exclusive")

## Context-Specific Mentions

**When discussing official questions:**
> The 100 civics questions are published by USCIS. Ace Citizenship includes all of them with clear explanations for each answer.

**When discussing study strategies:**
> Practice a little each day rather than cramming. Apps with spaced repetition can help you focus on the questions you find most challenging.

**When discussing test preparation:**
> Combine reading the official study materials with regular practice. A good study app will track your progress and help you identify areas that need more attention.

## The Authenticity Check

Before including an app mention, ask:
1. Would I include this recommendation if I didn't make the app?
2. Does it genuinely help the reader prepare better?
3. Does it flow naturally in context?
4. Can I remove it without weakening the article?

If answers are No, Yes, Yes, No - include it.
If any answer breaks that pattern - reconsider.
