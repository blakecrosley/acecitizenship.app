- Simple vocabulary (remember: many readers are learning English)

### Paragraph Style
- 2-4 sentences per paragraph
- Clear topic sentences
- White space for readability

### Word Choices

**Prefer:**
- "Prepare" over "study" or "memorize"
- "Practice" over "drill"
- "Interview" over "test" (when discussing the actual appointment)
- "Official" over "correct" (when citing USCIS)
- "You'll learn" over "you must know"

**Avoid:**
- "Fail" or "failure" (use "not pass" if needed)

- Jargon or legal terms without explanation
- Complex sentence structures

### Contractions

- Helps with accessibility for non-native speakers

## Example Passages

### Before (Anxiety-inducing):
> The citizenship test is notoriously difficult, with many applicants failing on their first attempt. You must memorize 100 civics questions perfectly, and any mistake could delay your journey by months. The interview process is stressful and intimidating.

### After (Ace Citizenship voice):
> The citizenship interview includes a civics portion with 100 possible questions. You'll be asked up to 10 and need to answer 6 correctly. With focused preparation, most applicants pass on their first try. The interview is a conversation, not an interrogation.

## Addressing the Reader

- Use "you" frequently and warmly
- Assume intelligence and dedication
- Acknowledge effort and commitment
- "As you prepare..." not "You should..."
- "When you answer..." not "If you answer correctly..."

## On the Journey

Remember: readers are pursuing one of the most significant goals of their lives. Treat this with the respect it deserves:
- Never minimize the importance
- Never make light of the effort required
- Always reinforce that the goal is achievable
- Connect preparation to success, not fear to failure

## The Confidence Check

Before publishing, ask: Does this article make someone feel more confident and better prepared? If reading this would increase anxiety rather than capability, revise until it empowers.
