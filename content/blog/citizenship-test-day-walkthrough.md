You've studied the civics questions, practiced your English, and prepared your documents. Now your interview day is approaching. Knowing exactly what to expect helps you walk in with confidence. Here's a complete walkthrough of the naturalization interview process.

## Before You Arrive

### What to Bring

Gather these items the night before:

**Required:**
- Your interview appointment notice (Form I-797C)
- Your Permanent Resident Card (Green Card)
- A valid government-issued photo ID (passport or state ID)
- Any documents requested in your appointment letter

**If applicable:**
- Passport and travel records (if you traveled during your residency period)
- Tax returns for the past 5 years (or 3 years if married to a U.S. citizen)
- Court documents (if you've had any legal issues)
- Evidence of Selective Service registration (for men 18-25)
- Marriage certificate and spouse's documents (if applicable)

**Helpful to have:**
- A copy of your completed N-400 application
- Your A-number written down separately
- A folder or envelope to keep documents organized

### Getting There

Plan to arrive 15-30 minutes early. Consider:
- Traffic and parking availability
- Time to pass through security screening
- Walking distance from parking to the building

Late arrivals may be rescheduled, so give yourself extra time.

## Arriving at the USCIS Office

### Security Screening

Like an airport, you'll go through security when entering the USCIS office. Remove any metal objects and be prepared to have your bags checked.

**Leave these at home or in your car:**
- Weapons of any kind
- Food and drinks (some offices prohibit them)
- Large bags or luggage
- Electronic devices may need to be turned off

### Check-In Process

After security, proceed to the check-in desk or window. You'll:
- Present your appointment notice
- Show your Green Card and photo ID
- Receive instructions on where to wait

The waiting room typically has seating and information displays. Your name or number will be called when the officer is ready.

## The Interview Begins

### Meeting Your Officer

A USCIS officer will call your name and escort you to their office. They'll ask you to remain standing and raise your right hand for the oath.

**The Oath:** You'll swear or affirm to tell the truth during the interview. This is standard procedure.

After the oath, you'll sit down and the interview begins.

### Identity Verification

The officer will first confirm your identity by:
- Examining your Green Card and photo ID
- Asking you to confirm your name, date of birth, and A-number
- Potentially taking your photo or fingerprints

This usually takes just a few minutes.

## The N-400 Review

The officer will go through your N-400 application, asking you to confirm or clarify information. They may ask about:

- Your current and past addresses
- Employment history
- Travel outside the United States
- Marital status and family information
- Criminal history or legal issues
- Tax filing history

**Important tips:**
- Answer truthfully and consistently with your application
- If something has changed since you filed, inform the officer
- If you don't understand a question, ask for clarification
- It's okay to take a moment to think before answering

The officer is looking for consistency and honesty, not trick questions.

## The Civics and English Tests

### The Civics Test

The officer will ask you up to 10 questions from the 100 official civics questions. You need to answer 6 correctly to pass.

**What it's like:**
- Questions are asked verbally
- You answer verbally (no writing)
- The officer marks each answer as correct or incorrect
- Once you get 6 correct, the test ends
- If you get 4 wrong, you'll continue until you pass or fail

The officer may ask questions in a different order than you studied. This is normal. Take a breath and focus on each question as it comes.

### The English Reading Test

You'll be given a sentence to read aloud. The sentence relates to civics topics and uses vocabulary from the official reading list.

**What to expect:**
- A sentence on a card or screen
- You read it out loud
- You have up to three attempts to read correctly
- Focus on understanding and pronunciation

Example sentences might include: "George Washington was the first president" or "Citizens can vote for the president."

### The English Writing Test

The officer will dictate a sentence for you to write on paper or a tablet.

**What to expect:**
- A simple sentence related to civics
- You write it down as dictated
- You have up to three attempts
- Spelling and punctuation don't need to be perfect, but should be understandable

Example sentences might include: "The American flag has stars and stripes" or "Congress makes federal laws."

## After the Tests

### The Officer's Decision

In most cases, the officer will inform you of the decision before you leave. There are three possible outcomes:

**Approved:** You passed all requirements and will receive information about your oath ceremony. Some offices conduct same-day ceremonies.

**Continued:** The officer needs additional documentation or time to make a decision. You'll receive instructions on next steps.

**Denied:** You didn't meet the requirements. The officer will explain the reasons. You may have options to appeal or reapply depending on the circumstances.

If you don't pass the civics or English test, you'll be scheduled for a re-examination within 60-90 days. You only need to retake the portion you didn't pass.

## Common Questions About Interview Day

**How long does the interview take?**

Most interviews last 15-30 minutes. If your case is complex or requires additional review, it may take longer.

**What if I'm late?**

Arrive as early as possible. If you're late, check in anyway—you may still be seen, or you may be rescheduled. Don't assume your interview is cancelled without checking.

**Can I bring someone with me?**

You can have someone accompany you to the USCIS office, but they typically cannot enter the interview room unless they're serving as an interpreter (if approved in advance) or you require an accommodation.

**What if I need to reschedule?**

Contact USCIS as soon as possible if you cannot attend. Rescheduling without good cause may delay your case significantly.

**What if I get nervous and blank on a question?**

It's okay to pause and think. If you don't know an answer, the officer will move to the next question. Remember, you can miss up to 4 questions and still pass.

**What if I don't understand the officer?**

Politely ask them to repeat the question. Officers are accustomed to working with applicants from diverse language backgrounds.

## Tips for a Successful Interview

**Be punctual.** Arriving early reduces stress and shows respect for the process.

**Dress appropriately.** Business casual is a good choice. You want to appear that you're taking this seriously.

**Stay calm.** The officer wants you to succeed. This is a standard procedure they conduct many times daily.

**Listen carefully.** Make sure you understand each question before answering. Ask for clarification if needed.

**Be honest.** If you don't know an answer, say so. Don't guess or make up information.

**Bring organized documents.** Having your papers in order makes the process smoother for everyone.

## After Your Interview

If approved, your next step is the oath ceremony. At this ceremony, you'll take the Oath of Allegiance and officially become a U.S. citizen. Some offices offer same-day ceremonies; others schedule them separately.

After the oath ceremony, you'll receive your Certificate of Naturalization. Keep this document safe—it's proof of your citizenship.

## You're Ready

Interview day can feel significant, and it is. But it's also manageable. You've prepared, you know what to expect, and you're ready to take this important step.

Approach your interview as a conversation, not a test. The officer is verifying information and confirming your qualifications. Your preparation has given you the tools to succeed.

If you're still preparing for your interview, consistent practice with the civics questions builds the confidence you'll carry into that room. Ace Citizenship can help you study all 128 official questions so you're fully prepared.
