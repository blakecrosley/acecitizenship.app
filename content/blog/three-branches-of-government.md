# Understanding the Three Branches of Government

The U.S. government is divided into three branches. This design ensures no single group holds too much power. Understanding these branches is essential for your citizenship test—and for life as an American citizen.

## Why Three Branches?

The Founding Fathers created this system of "separation of powers" after experiencing rule under a king. They wanted to prevent any one person or group from having absolute control. Each branch has specific responsibilities and can check the power of the others.

This concept appears in several citizenship test questions. Let's explore each branch so you understand not just the answers, but the reasons behind them.

## The Legislative Branch: Congress

**What it does:** Makes the laws

The Legislative Branch is Congress, which has two parts:

- **The Senate** — 100 senators, 2 from each state
- **The House of Representatives** — 435 representatives, based on state population

### Key Facts for Your Test

- Congress meets in the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C.
- Only Congress can declare war
- Congress creates and passes laws
- The Senate confirms presidential appointments
- The House can impeach federal officials

### Common Test Questions

You may be asked: "What does Congress do?" The answer is that Congress makes federal laws. You might also be asked about the number of senators (100) or how many years they serve (6 years).

## The Executive Branch: The President

**What it does:** Enforces the laws

The President leads the Executive Branch. This branch also includes the Vice President, Cabinet members, and federal agencies.

### Key Facts for Your Test

- The President serves a 4-year term
- A President can serve a maximum of two terms (8 years total)
- The President signs bills into law or vetoes them
- The President is Commander in Chief of the military
- The Cabinet advises the President

### Common Test Questions

Test questions often ask about presidential powers. Remember: the President signs bills into law, leads the military, and represents the country internationally.

You'll need to know who the current President and Vice President are at the time of your interview.

## The Judicial Branch: The Courts

**What it does:** Interprets the laws

The Judicial Branch is the federal court system, led by the Supreme Court.

### Key Facts for Your Test

- The Supreme Court is the highest court in the country
- There are 9 Supreme Court justices
- The Chief Justice leads the Supreme Court
- Justices serve for life (until they retire, die, or are removed)
- The Supreme Court can declare laws unconstitutional

### Common Test Questions

You should know that the Supreme Court reviews laws and that the Chief Justice leads it. You may also be asked who the current Chief Justice is.

## Checks and Balances: How the Branches Work Together

The branches don't work in isolation. They check each other's power:

| Branch | Checks On |
|--------|-----------|
| Congress | Can override presidential vetoes, approve judges, impeach officials |
| President | Can veto laws, appoint judges, pardon federal crimes |
| Supreme Court | Can declare laws or actions unconstitutional |

This system of checks and balances is a fundamental principle of American government. It ensures that power remains distributed among the three branches.

## Test Questions to Practice

Here are the key citizenship test questions about the branches:

1. **What are the three branches of government?**
   Legislative, Executive, Judicial

2. **What stops one branch from becoming too powerful?**
   Checks and balances / Separation of powers

3. **Who makes federal laws?**
   Congress

4. **What does the President's Cabinet do?**
   Advises the President

5. **What is the highest court in the United States?**
   The Supreme Court

## Connecting the Concepts

When you prepare for your interview, think about how these branches connect:

- **A new law starts** as a bill in Congress (Legislative)
- **The President signs** it into law (Executive)
- **Citizens can challenge** the law in court (Judicial)
- **The Supreme Court decides** if the law follows the Constitution

Understanding this flow helps you answer questions confidently, even if the wording is slightly different from what you practiced.

## Keep Practicing

The three branches appear in multiple test questions. As you prepare, focus on understanding *why* this system exists, not just memorizing facts. When you understand the purpose behind the design, the answers become easier to remember.

Practice regularly with official USCIS questions. Ace Citizenship includes all 100 civics questions with clear explanations, helping you understand the reasoning behind each answer—not just memorize responses.

You're building knowledge that will serve you as an informed American citizen. Every question you master brings you closer to your goal.
