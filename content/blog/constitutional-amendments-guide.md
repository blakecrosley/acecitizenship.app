# Key Constitutional Amendments Beyond the Bill of Rights

The Constitution has 27 amendments. While the first 10 (the Bill of Rights) get the most attention, later amendments made dramatic changes to American life. Several appear on the citizenship test.

## How Amendments Work

The Constitution is difficult to change by design. An amendment requires:

1. Two-thirds approval from both houses of Congress
2. Ratification by three-fourths of state legislatures

This high bar means amendments reflect broad national agreement. Only 27 have been added in over 230 years.

## Amendments That Ended Slavery and Expanded Rights

### The 13th Amendment (1865)

**Abolished slavery**

After the Civil War, this amendment made slavery illegal throughout the United States. No person can be held as a slave or forced into involuntary servitude.

This is frequently tested. Remember: The 13th Amendment freed the slaves.

### The 14th Amendment (1868)

**Citizenship and equal protection**

This amendment established that:

- Anyone born in the United States is a citizen
- States must provide equal protection under the law
- Due process protections apply to state governments

The 14th Amendment is one of the most important in American law.

### The 15th Amendment (1870)

**Voting rights regardless of race**

This amendment gave all male citizens the right to vote, regardless of race or former status as slaves.

## Amendments That Expanded Voting Rights

The Constitution originally left voting rules to the states. Several amendments expanded who can vote:

### The 19th Amendment (1920)

**Women's right to vote**

This amendment gave women the right to vote nationwide. Before this, only some states allowed women to vote.

This is a commonly tested amendment. Remember: The 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote.

### The 24th Amendment (1964)

**Abolished poll taxes**

Some states required payment to vote, which prevented poor citizens from participating. This amendment eliminated poll taxes in federal elections.

### The 26th Amendment (1971)

**Voting age lowered to 18**

During the Vietnam War, people argued that if 18-year-olds could be drafted to fight, they should be able to vote. This amendment lowered the voting age from 21 to 18.

## Other Important Amendments

### The 22nd Amendment (1951)

**Presidential term limits**

A President can serve only two terms (8 years maximum). This was added after Franklin Roosevelt served four terms.

Test question: A President can serve for how many years?
Answer: 8 years (or two 4-year terms)

### The 16th Amendment (1913)

**Federal income tax**

This amendment gave Congress the power to collect income taxes. Before this, the federal government had limited ability to tax individual income.

### The 18th and 21st Amendments

The 18th Amendment (1919) banned alcohol—this was called Prohibition.

The 21st Amendment (1933) repealed Prohibition, making alcohol legal again.

This is the only time an amendment was repealed by another amendment.

## Test Questions About Amendments

Know these for your interview:

**Q: What did the 19th Amendment do?**
A: Gave women the right to vote

**Q: What is one right that is only for United States citizens?**
A: Vote in a federal election (or run for federal office)

**Q: Who can vote in federal elections?**
A: Citizens 18 years and older

**Q: What are two ways Americans can participate in democracy?**
A: Vote, join a political party, run for office, write to elected officials, join a civic group

## Understanding the Pattern

Notice how amendments expanded rights over time:

1. **1865** — Former slaves became free
2. **1868** — Former slaves became citizens
3. **1870** — Black men could vote
4. **1920** — Women could vote
5. **1964** — Poll taxes eliminated
6. **1971** — 18-year-olds could vote

Each amendment made America more democratic by including more people in the political process.

## Why This Matters

As a new citizen, you'll have rights protected by these amendments:

- **Equal protection** under the law
- **The right to vote** in all elections
- **Protection from discrimination** based on race, gender, or background

Understanding these amendments helps you appreciate what citizenship means. Each represents a struggle by Americans to make the country more fair and free.

## Focus Your Study

For the citizenship test, prioritize:

1. **13th Amendment** — Abolished slavery
2. **19th Amendment** — Women's voting rights
3. **The concept of amendments** — How the Constitution can change

You don't need to memorize amendment numbers for most questions. Focus on what each important amendment accomplished.

As you practice, connect amendments to the broader story of American rights expanding over time. You're joining that story as a new citizen.
