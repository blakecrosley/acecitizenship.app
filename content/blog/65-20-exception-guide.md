# The 65/20 Exception: Special Accommodations for Older Applicants

The naturalization process includes accommodations for older applicants who have lived in the U.S. for many years. The 65/20 exception offers a shorter civics test and the option to take it in your native language. Here's everything you need to know.

## Understanding the Exceptions

USCIS offers three main age-based exceptions:

### The 50/20 Exception

**Requirements:**
- Age 50 or older
- Permanent resident for at least 20 years

**Accommodation:**
- May take the civics test in your native language
- Must still take civics test (100 questions)
- English requirement waived

### The 55/15 Exception

**Requirements:**
- Age 55 or older
- Permanent resident for at least 15 years

**Accommodation:**
- May take the civics test in your native language
- Must still take civics test (100 questions)
- English requirement waived

### The 65/20 Exception (Most Accommodating)

**Requirements:**
- Age 65 or older
- Permanent resident for at least 20 years

**Accommodations:**
- May take the civics test in your native language
- **Shorter civics test** — Only 20 questions (marked with asterisk on the official list)
- English requirement waived

## Who Qualifies for 65/20

You qualify if you meet **both** requirements at the time of your interview:

**Age requirement:** You must be 65 years old or older.

**Residency requirement:** You must have been a lawful permanent resident (green card holder) for at least 20 years.

### Calculating Your Eligibility

Count from the date you became a permanent resident (the date on your green card) to your interview date.

**Example:**
- Became permanent resident: January 15, 2005
- Interview date: March 1, 2025
- Time as resident: 20 years
- Age at interview: 67

This person qualifies for the 65/20 exception.

## What Changes with 65/20

### The Civics Test

**Standard test:** Up to 10 questions from 100 possible; must answer 6 correctly

**65/20 test:** Up to 10 questions from only 20 possible; must answer 6 correctly

The 20 questions are marked with an asterisk (*) on the official USCIS list. You only need to study these 20.

### Language

You may take the civics test in your native language. You'll need to bring your own interpreter who can:

- Speak both English and your native language fluently
- Translate questions and answers accurately
- Be available for the entire interview

USCIS does not provide interpreters. Some community organizations help arrange them.

### English Requirement

The English requirement is completely waived:
- No English speaking test
- No English reading test
- No English writing test

The civics portion is the only test.

## The 20 Questions (65/20 List)

Here are the 20 civics questions for the 65/20 exception:

### American Government

1. What is one right or freedom from the First Amendment?
2. What is the economic system in the United States?
3. Name one branch or part of the government.
4. What are the two parts of the U.S. Congress?
5. Who is one of your state's U.S. Senators now?
6. In what month do we vote for President?
7. What is the name of the President of the United States now?
8. What is the capital of your state?
9. What are the two major political parties in the United States?
10. What is one responsibility that is only for United States citizens?
11. How old do citizens have to be to vote for President?

### American History

12. What is one reason colonists came to America?
13. Who lived in America before the Europeans arrived?

17. What did the Emancipation Proclamation do?
18. What did Martin Luther King, Jr. do?
19. What is one war fought by the United States in the 1900s?

### Integrated Civics

20. Name one U.S. territory.

**That's it.** Focus your study on these 20 questions only.

## Preparing Under 65/20

### Shorter Study Time

With only 20 questions, preparation is significantly simpler:
- Learn all 20 questions and their answers
- Practice saying or writing answers clearly
- Review regularly until all 20 feel automatic

### Using an Interpreter

If using an interpreter:

**Before the interview:**
- Find an interpreter you trust
- Practice with them before interview day
- Ensure they understand the questions and answers
- Confirm their availability

**Interpreter requirements:**
- Must be fluent in English and your native language
- Cannot be your attorney
- Must be able to translate accurately
- Should dress professionally

**During the interview:**
- Interpreter translates the officer's questions
- You answer in your native language
- Interpreter translates your answer to English

### Current Information

Even with the shorter test, you need to know current information:
- Current President's name
- Your state's U.S. Senators
- Your state's capital

Verify these are correct before your interview.

## Common Questions About 65/20

### Can I still take the test in English?

Yes. The exception allows you to use your native language; it doesn't require it. If you're comfortable in English, you can take the test in English.

### Do I need documentation to qualify?

Your N-400 application shows your permanent residence date. USCIS will verify your eligibility. Your age is on your identification documents.

### What if I turn 65 after filing but before my interview?

If you meet the requirements at the time of your interview, you qualify. File early if you'll meet the requirements by your likely interview date.

### Can my family member be my interpreter?

Yes, family members can serve as interpreters if they're fluent in both languages. However, they cannot be your attorney.

### What if I don't pass?

If you don't answer 6 questions correctly, you'll be scheduled for a re-examination (just like standard applicants). You'll have another opportunity to pass.

## Study Strategy for 65/20
