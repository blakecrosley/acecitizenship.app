# Citizenship Reading Test: Complete Vocabulary Guide

The citizenship test includes a reading portion where you'll read a sentence aloud in English. This guide covers every vocabulary word you need to know and strategies to practice effectively.

## How the Reading Test Works

## Practice Strategies

### Read Aloud Daily

Practice reading these words out loud every day. Reading silently is not enough—you need to hear yourself pronounce the words.

1. Read each word slowly and clearly
2. Read the practice sentences
3. Focus on words you find difficult
4. Record yourself and listen back

### Focus on Trouble Spots

Some words are commonly mispronounced:

- **February** — Feb-roo-air-ee (the first "r" is often skipped)
- **Wednesday** — Wenz-day (the "d" is silent)
- **Government** — Guv-ern-ment (three syllables)
- **President** — Prez-i-dent (three syllables)

Practice these until they feel natural.

### Build Confidence with Combinations

Practice combining words as they appear in sentences:

- "The President lives..."
- "Citizens can vote..."
- "Congress meets in..."
- "Independence Day is..."

### Use Multiple Senses

- **See** the words written
- **Say** them out loud
- **Hear** yourself speaking
- **Write** them by hand

Using multiple senses helps words stick in your memory.

## Sample Sentences

Here are example sentences similar to what you'll see on the test:

1. Abraham Lincoln was the President during the Civil War.
2. George Washington is on the dollar bill.
3. Independence Day is in July.
4. Citizens can vote.
5. The United States flag is red, white, and blue.
6. Congress meets in Washington, D.C.
7. The President lives in the White House.
8. People vote for the President in November.
9. Memorial Day is in May.
10. The first President was George Washington.

Practice reading each sentence clearly and at a normal pace.

## Tips for Test Day

**Stay calm.** Nervousness can affect pronunciation. Take a breath before you read.

**Read at a normal pace.** Don't rush. Speaking too quickly can cause mistakes.

**It's okay to start over.** If you stumble, you can begin the sentence again.

**Focus on being understood.** Perfect pronunciation isn't required. The officer just needs to understand what you're reading.
