The U.S. citizenship test is a significant milestone on your path to becoming an American citizen. With the right preparation, you can approach your interview with confidence. This guide covers everything you need to know about the citizenship test in 2026.

## What Is the Citizenship Test?

The citizenship test is part of your naturalization interview with a USCIS officer. During this interview, you'll demonstrate your knowledge of U.S. history and government, as well as your ability to read, write, and speak English.

The test consists of three main parts:

1. **Civics Test** - Questions about U.S. history and government
2. **English Reading Test** - Reading a sentence aloud
3. **English Writing Test** - Writing a sentence from dictation

## The Civics Test Explained

The civics portion draws from a pool of 100 official questions published by USCIS. During your interview, the officer will ask you up to 10 questions from this list. You need to answer 6 correctly to pass.

The questions cover several categories:

- **American Government** - The Constitution, branches of government, rights and responsibilities
- **American History** - Colonial period, the 1800s, recent history, and holidays
- **Integrated Civics** - Geography, symbols, and national celebrations

Some answers change based on where you live and current events. For example, you'll need to know your state's senators and your congressional representative. The current president and vice president are always testable.

## Reading and Writing Requirements

The English portion tests basic reading and writing skills using vocabulary from official USCIS word lists.

**Reading Test**: You'll be asked to read one sentence aloud. The officer will give you three chances to read correctly. The sentences use simple vocabulary related to civics concepts.

**Writing Test**: The officer will dictate a sentence for you to write. Again, you have three chances. The sentences use the same simplified vocabulary as the reading test.

These aren't trick questions. USCIS wants to confirm you have basic English skills, not test complex grammar.

## Who Qualifies for Accommodations?

USCIS offers accommodations for certain applicants:

**The 50/20 Rule**: If you're 50 or older and have been a permanent resident for at least 20 years, you may take the civics test in your native language.

**The 55/15 Rule**: If you're 55 or older with at least 15 years as a permanent resident, you also qualify for a native language civics test.

**The 65/20 Rule**: Applicants 65 or older with 20+ years of residency may take a simplified civics test with only 20 possible questions (instead of 100). You'll be asked 10 and must answer 6 correctly.

Request accommodations when you file your N-400 application.

## How to Prepare Effectively

### Start Early

Give yourself at least 2-3 months of study time. Consistent daily practice of 15-30 minutes is more effective than occasional cramming sessions.

### Use Official Materials

USCIS provides free study materials on their website, including:
- The complete list of 100 civics questions and answers
- Reading and writing vocabulary lists
- Flash cards and practice tests

### Focus on Understanding

Rather than pure memorization, try to understand the concepts. When you know why the Constitution has amendments or how the branches of government check each other, the answers become easier to remember.

### Practice Speaking

The interview is conducted in English. Practice speaking your answers aloud, not just reading them silently. This builds confidence and helps with pronunciation.

### Learn Current Information

Make sure you know:
- The current U.S. president and vice president
- Your state's two senators
- Your congressional representative
- Your state's governor
- Your state's capital

These answers aren't in the official study materials because they change based on elections and location.

## What to Expect on Interview Day

Your naturalization interview typically lasts 15-30 minutes. The officer will:

1. Verify your identity and review your N-400 application
2. Place you under oath
3. Ask about your background, residence, and character
4. Conduct the civics and English tests
5. Inform you of the decision or next steps

Most applicants receive a decision the same day. If approved, you'll receive information about your oath ceremony.

## Tips for Success

**Stay calm.** The officer wants you to succeed. Take your time with questions.

**Ask for clarification.** If you don't understand a question, politely ask the officer to repeat it.

**Don't overthink.** Answer what's asked. You don't need to provide extra information.

**Be honest.** If you don't know an answer, it's better to say so than to guess incorrectly.

**Review your N-400.** The officer will ask questions from your application. Know the dates, addresses, and details you provided.

## Common Questions Answered

**What if I fail the civics or English test?**

You'll be scheduled for a second interview within 60-90 days. Use that time to prepare for the specific areas where you need improvement.

**Can I bring notes or study materials?**

No. You cannot use any study aids during the interview.

**What if I get nervous and forget an answer?**

The officer may skip to another question and return to it later. Remember, you need 6 out of 10 correct, so you have room for a few missed questions.

## Your Path Forward

The citizenship test is achievable with focused preparation. Millions of people pass each year, and with consistent study, you'll be ready too.

Start with the official USCIS materials, practice a little each day, and approach your interview with confidence. Your journey to citizenship is worth every moment of preparation.
