# What to Bring to Your Citizenship Interview: Complete Checklist

Your interview appointment letter tells you when and where to appear. But what should you bring? This checklist ensures you arrive prepared with everything you need.

## Required Documents

### Your Interview Appointment Notice

**Form I-797C** — This is the letter USCIS sent scheduling your interview.

Bring the original notice. It contains:
- Your appointment date and time
- The USCIS office location
- Instructions for your visit

Without this, you may have difficulty checking in.

### Your Permanent Resident Card (Green Card)

Bring your current, valid green card. If your card has expired but you have a valid extension sticker or I-797, bring those too.

If your green card was lost or stolen, bring:
- The police report (if stolen)
- Receipt for your I-90 replacement application

### Valid Photo Identification

Bring a government-issued photo ID, such as:
- Passport (from any country)
- Driver's license
- State-issued ID card

Your green card alone may be sufficient, but a second form of ID is helpful.

### Your Passport and Travel Documents

Bring **all passports** you've used since becoming a permanent resident. This includes:
- Current passport
- Expired passports
- Any passports from previous countries

USCIS reviews your travel history during the interview.

## Documents Related to Your Application

### Copy of Your N-400 Application

Bring a copy of the N-400 form you submitted. This helps you:
- Review your answers before the interview
- Clarify any information if asked
- Update information if needed

### Evidence Supporting Your Application

If your application required supporting documents, bring copies:

**For marriage-based applicants:**
- Marriage certificate
- Evidence of living together (bills, lease, photos)
- Divorce decrees from prior marriages (if applicable)

**For military service:**
- DD-214 or military orders
- Proof of current service (if applicable)

**For applicants with arrests or legal issues:**
- Court dispositions
- Arrest records
- Evidence of case outcomes

## Documents for Specific Situations

### If Your Name Has Changed

Bring legal documents showing any name changes:
- Marriage certificates
- Divorce decrees
- Court orders for name changes

### If You Have Children

Bring birth certificates for:
- Children listed on your N-400
- Children born since you applied

### If You Claimed Tax Filing Status

If relevant questions arose about taxes:
- Tax returns for the past 5 years (or 3 years for spouse-based)
- IRS transcripts if available

### If You Have Trips Outside the U.S.

Be prepared to discuss:
- Dates of each trip
- Duration of each trip
- Reason for travel

If any trip exceeded 6 months, bring documentation explaining the trip and your ties to the U.S. during that time.

## Organizing Your Documents

Create a folder or binder with your documents organized in order:

1. **Interview notice** on top
2. **Identification** (green card, passport)
3. **N-400 copy**

## What Happens If You Forget Something

If you realize you've forgotten a required document:

**Before the interview:** Still attend. Explain the situation. The officer may:
- Request you mail the document later
- Schedule a follow-up appointment
- Proceed without it if not critical

**Missing green card or ID:** This may prevent your interview from proceeding. Contact USCIS before your appointment if possible.

- Make a good impression

You've prepared for the civics test. You've practiced English. Now make sure you have the paperwork to match.

Arrive early, stay calm, and trust your preparation. You're ready for this.
