# American History Questions on the Citizenship Test

American history spans centuries of change, struggle, and progress. The citizenship test includes questions about key moments that shaped the nation. This guide covers the history you need to know.

## Colonial Period (1600s-1700s)

### Why Colonists Came to America

The first European colonists came to America for several reasons:

- **Freedom** — especially religious freedom
- **Political liberty** — escape from oppressive governments
- **Economic opportunity** — chance to own land and build wealth

When asked why colonists came to America, any of these answers is correct.

### The 13 Original Colonies

Before America was a country, it was 13 British colonies along the East Coast. These colonies declared independence in 1776 and became the first states.

You don't need to memorize all 13, but know they were located on the East Coast and later became states.

## The American Revolution (1775-1783)

### Why America Declared Independence

The colonists wanted independence from Britain because:

- **High taxes without representation** — they had no voice in Parliament
- **British army in their homes** — soldiers lived in colonists' houses
- **No self-government** — Britain controlled colonial laws

The famous phrase "no taxation without representation" captures the colonists' main complaint.

### The Declaration of Independence

On **July 4, 1776**, the Declaration of Independence was adopted. This document:

- Declared the colonies free from Britain
- Stated that all men are created equal
- Listed complaints against the King

**Thomas Jefferson** wrote the Declaration. This is a commonly tested fact.

### Key Figures of the Revolution

- **George Washington** — Led the Continental Army, became first President
- **Benjamin Franklin** — Diplomat who gained French support
- **Thomas Jefferson** — Wrote the Declaration of Independence

George Washington is called the "Father of Our Country" for his leadership.

## Creating the New Government (1787-1791)

### The Constitution

After independence, the states needed a new government. The **Constitution** was written in 1787 and is the supreme law of the land.

**James Madison** is called the "Father of the Constitution" for his central role in writing it.

### The Federalist Papers

To convince states to approve the Constitution, **Alexander Hamilton**, **James Madison**, and **John Jay** wrote the Federalist Papers. These essays explained why the new Constitution was needed.

## The 1800s: Growth and Conflict

### Westward Expansion

America grew dramatically in the 1800s:

- **Louisiana Purchase (1803)** — Doubled the nation's size
- **Oregon Territory** — Acquired through negotiation with Britain
- **Mexican Cession** — Added the Southwest after the Mexican-American War

The U.S. expanded from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean.

### The Civil War (1861-1865)

The Civil War was America's deadliest conflict. Key facts:

- **Cause:** Slavery (and states' rights related to slavery)
- **President:** Abraham Lincoln led the Union (North)
- **Result:** The Union won, slavery was abolished

**Abraham Lincoln** freed the slaves through the Emancipation Proclamation and is remembered as one of America's greatest presidents.

### Important Amendments

After the Civil War, three amendments changed America:

- **13th Amendment** — Abolished slavery
- **14th Amendment** — Gave citizenship to all persons born in the U.S.
- **15th Amendment** — Gave all men the right to vote regardless of race

## The 1900s: America as a World Power

### World Wars

America fought in two world wars:

- **World War I (1914-1918)** — U.S. joined in 1917, fought against Germany
- **World War II (1941-1945)** — U.S. joined after Pearl Harbor, fought against Germany, Japan, and Italy

### The Civil Rights Movement

In the 1950s and 1960s, Americans fought for equal rights for all citizens. **Martin Luther King Jr.** led peaceful protests for civil rights.

One test question asks what Martin Luther King Jr. did. Answer: He fought for civil rights or worked for equality for all Americans.

### September 11, 2001

The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, killed nearly 3,000 people. This led to significant changes in American security policy.
