# N-400 Application Guide: Tips for a Smooth Process

The N-400 is your application for naturalization—the formal request to become a U.S. citizen. This guide helps you understand the form, avoid common mistakes, and submit a complete application.

## What Is the N-400?

Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, is the official form to apply for U.S. citizenship. It collects information about:

- Your identity and background
- Your residence and employment history
- Your travel outside the U.S.
- Your eligibility for citizenship
- Your moral character

USCIS uses this information to determine if you qualify for naturalization.

## Before You Apply: Eligibility Check

Before completing the N-400, confirm you meet basic requirements:

### Standard Path (5-Year Rule)
- Age 18 or older
- Permanent resident for at least 5 years
- Physically present in the U.S. for at least 30 months during those 5 years
- Resided in your current state for at least 3 months
- Can read, write, and speak basic English
- Knowledge of U.S. history and government
- Good moral character

### Spouse of U.S. Citizen (3-Year Rule)
- Age 18 or older
- Permanent resident for at least 3 years
- Married to and living with a U.S. citizen for those 3 years
- Physically present in the U.S. for at least 18 months
- Other requirements same as above

## Gathering Information Before You Start

Collect this information before filling out the form:

### Personal Information
- All names you've used (maiden name, previous married names, nicknames)
- All addresses for the past 5 years
- All employers for the past 5 years
- Social Security number
- Immigration history (dates of green card, entry to U.S.)

### Travel History
- Every trip outside the U.S. in the past 5 years
- Dates of departure and return
- Countries visited
- Duration of each trip

### Family Information
- Current spouse information
- Previous spouse information (if divorced)
- Children's names, dates of birth, and addresses

### Legal History
- Any arrests (even if charges were dropped)
- Any citations (including traffic tickets that went to court)
- Any court appearances
- Tax filing history

## Section-by-Section Tips

### Part 1: Information About Your Eligibility

Select the correct basis for your application:
- Most applicants choose "A" (5-year resident)
- Spouses of U.S. citizens may choose "B" (3-year resident)

Choosing the wrong category can delay your application.

### Part 2: Information About You

**Name exactly as on green card.** If your name has changed since your green card was issued, explain the change and provide documentation.

**List all names used.** Include maiden names, nicknames (if used on official documents), and names from prior marriages.

### Part 4: Addresses and Telephone Numbers

**Current address must match** where you currently live. USCIS will send mail here.

**List all addresses** for the past 5 years. If you moved frequently, account for each address.

### Part 5: Employment and Schools

List all employers for the past 5 years. Include:
- Employer name and address
- Your job title
- Dates of employment

If unemployed, self-employed, or a homemaker during any period, indicate this.

### Part 6: Information About Your Residence

This section asks about your history in your current state. You must have lived in the state where you're applying for at least 3 months.

### Part 7: Time Outside the United States

**List every trip** outside the U.S. in the past 5 years. Include:
- Short vacations
- Work trips
- Family visits

Be accurate about dates. USCIS can verify your travel through passport stamps and records.

### Part 8: Marital History

Provide complete information about:
- Current marriage (date, location, spouse's information)
- All previous marriages (even brief ones)
- How previous marriages ended (divorce, death, annulment)

### Part 9: Information About Your Children

List all children, regardless of:
- Age
- Where they live
- Their immigration status
- Whether you have custody

### Part 10: Additional Questions About You

This section covers moral character and asks about:

**Legal issues:**
- Arrests, citations, detentions
- Crimes committed (even if never arrested)
- Court appearances

**Tax obligations:**
- Whether you've filed required returns
- Whether you owe taxes

**Immigration violations:**
- Overstaying visas
- Unlawful presence
- Deportation proceedings

**Answer honestly.** Lying on the N-400 can result in denial and future immigration problems. Past issues don't automatically disqualify you, but dishonesty does.

### Part 11: Your Signature

Review everything before signing. Your signature confirms the information is true and complete.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Incomplete Information
Every blank space should be filled. If something doesn't apply, write "N/A" (not applicable).

### 2. Inconsistent Names
Use your legal name consistently. If your name appears differently on various documents, explain the differences.

### 3. Forgetting Travel
Many applicants forget short trips. Check your passport and calendars to list every departure.

### 4. Not Disclosing Arrests
Even if charges were dropped or you were found not guilty, disclose arrests. Not disclosing can be considered fraud.

### 5. Wrong Address
Using a work address or PO Box when you live elsewhere can cause problems. Use your actual residence.

### 6. Missing Fee Payment
Submit the correct fee. Check USCIS.gov for current fees, as they change periodically.

## After You Submit

### What to Expect

1. **Receipt notice** — Confirms USCIS received your application
2. **Biometrics appointment** — You'll be fingerprinted
3. **Interview notice** — Schedules your naturalization interview
4. **Decision** — Approval, denial, or request for more information

### Timeline

Processing times vary by location. Check USCIS.gov for current estimates for your area. Many applicants complete the process in 6-12 months.

### Updating Information

If anything changes after you submit (address, employment, marital status), notify USCIS promptly.

## Tips for Success

1. **Make copies** — Keep a complete copy of your application and all documents
2. **Be thorough** — Take time to provide complete, accurate information
3. **Be honest** — Disclose everything, even if you think it might be problematic
4. **Organize documents** — Keep supporting documents ready for your interview
5. **Check fees** — Ensure correct payment to avoid rejection

## Moving Forward

The N-400 is comprehensive, but it's manageable when you take it section by section. Gather your information first, fill out the form carefully, and review before submitting.

Once submitted, use your waiting time to prepare for the interview: study civics questions, practice English, and gather your documents.

This application is your formal step toward citizenship. Take it seriously, complete it accurately, and you'll be on your way to your naturalization interview.
